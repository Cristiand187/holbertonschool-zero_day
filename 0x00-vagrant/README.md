## :computer: Task

### [0. Create and setup your Git and Github account](./README.md)
Git is installed on the iMacs provided by Holberton, but if you’re using another computer, you might have to [install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) yourself.
 * Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. [Tips](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

On [Github.com](https://github.com/):

* Using the graphic interface on the website, create your first repository
    * Name: holbertonschool-zero_day
    * Description: I'm now a Holberton Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
    * Public repo
    * No README, .gitignore, or license
    * On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

Navigate to your home directory. [Tips](https://linuxconfig.org/single-linux-command-to-return-to-home-directory)
* Create a directory holbertonschool-zero_day. [Tips](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting)
* Navigate to this new directory. [Tips](https://askubuntu.com/questions/232442/how-do-i-navigate-between-directories-in-terminal)
* Initialize git and add the remote origin
* Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in all Holberton School projects
* Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)

Good job!

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first Holberton School project.

### [1. Hello Ubuntu](./0-hello_ubuntu)
Inside the holbertonschool-zero_day repo, create a new directory called 0x00-vagrant. Add a README.md file to this directory.

ssh into your Ubuntu VM. What does the command uname print when you run it without any option?

Type your answer into a file in the 0x00-vagrant directory and push it to GitHub. Name your file accordingly as shown below.
